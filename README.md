Reinforcement Learning Basics and Classic Problems

This is a repository for all the reinforcement learning algorithms coded from scratch.
The problems discussed are the classic problems discussed in Sutton and Burto.
Running the code is self explainatory. Various topics are subclassed in directories and data would be in the same repository if needed.


For example:

Following is the optimal policy of the Gambler Problem for P_head=0.25.
